## Summary

* The model appears to predict healthy loans more accuretley than high risk loans. I see this as a positive for the bank issuing the loans as it represents a lower risk. For example, if they determin the loan is unhealth when it actually may have been healthy than the adage of "nothing ventured nothing lost" apllies. If, however the bank were to issue a loan that was determined healthy when it actually wasn't, the bank may lose money.
